# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

**Each Pull Request sent should comply to this, if somewhat violation is noticed later, it can be labelled as `Invalid` or `Spam`, so, read this carefully.**

# ADDING NEW QUESTION AND SOLUTION :

- Add a question that is already not present .
- Your folder should be inside the question providers folder (like HackerRank ,CodeChef) if the folder is not present then do add your question folder to the `others` folder .  
- Your folder name should be **name_of_the_problem** .
- Your folder must contain *`Question.md`* and *`Solution.extension`*
- `Question.md` will contain the question itself with `Sample test cases` , `Sample Input/Output` and `Constraints`.
- `solution.extension` is the file that will have your solution and `.extension` is the extension of your solution language .
- Each File should contain `author : your name` and `Question Link : your-question-link` as comments at the begining of the file.
- You can add one file preferably named as `readme.md` which will contain the code explanations.
- We expect `Solutions` should be well documented to explain the purpose of the codes.
- Solutions should be `properly indented`.
- Solutions should be strictly designed by you, Code from other coding platforms (that doesn't belong to you) are not accepted and will be marked `invalid` if evidence found.

# DOCUMENTATION CONTRIBUTION:

You may contribute to the README or any of the documentation files if you want to improve it. We will be happy to update useful changes , But your PR will be accepted if and only it adds value to the repo . 

# IMPORTANT POINTS BEFORE SENDING PULL REQUESTS:

- Your `Solution` should be strictly in the `"solution.extension"` file like `solution.c`, other formats are not accepted
- Maintainers should be able to update changes.
- The `readme.md` should not include any **LOGIC or IDEA** for solving the problem.
- **More emphasis is given on understanding the logic used to get the solution rather than the code itself**. Hence simply copy-pasting code is not encouraged.
- Authenticity is expected and respected for every PULL REQUEST(s).

**You can expect your PR(s) to get merged if you follow the points and we expect a lot of contributions from your end to make this repository a powerful one, raising the standards!!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ”¥**

**Happy Contributing DEVs** :wink:
